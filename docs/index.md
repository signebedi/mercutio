## Overview

    - **skills**: [optional] athletics, acrobatics, sleight, stealth, arcana, history, investigation, nature, religion, animal-handling, insight, medicine, perception, survival, deception, intimidation, performance, persuasion
    - **equipment**: [optional]
    - **weapons**: [optional]
    - **tools**: [optional]

- **buffs**: character customizations that impact their proficiencies: class, race, religion, language, background.

    - **class**: [default] fighter, wizard, rogue, cleric
    - **race**: [optional] 'human, elf, wood elf, high elf, dark elf, dwarf, hill dwarf, mountain dwarf, halfling, stout halfling, lightfoot halfling

## Future Features

In the future, support may be added for vital data such as alignment, experience, size, speed, and hit-points. 

## Use Cases

Mercutio provides a number of features that may prove useful for:

- Programmers that write games but don't like developing player stats from scratch
- Dungeon Masters looking to automate character creation and dice rolls
- Everyday enthusiasts interested in learning more about Python and gaming

You can always add a [Github issue](https://github.com/signebedi/mercutio/issues) if there are features that might be useful to additional audiences.
